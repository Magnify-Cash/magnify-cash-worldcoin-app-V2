-   **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript), Supabase (Authentication, PostgreSQL, Real-time Subscriptions, Edge Functions).
-   **Blockchain:** World Chain (Chain ID 480) integration via Wagmi & Viem, World ID SDK (`@worldcoin/idkit`, `@worldcoin/minikit-js`, `@worldcoin/minikit-react`). RPC via QuickNode.
-   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (`pragma solidity ^0.8.25;` or higher recommended). Contracts built on OpenZeppelin libraries (V1, V2, and V3 versions exist).
-   **Package Manager:** pnpm

## Architecture

The application comprises several core subsystems:

-   **Frontend (React/Vite):** User interface, state management, and interaction with backend and blockchain.
-   **Backend (Cloudflare Workers):** Handles API requests, business logic, database operations (via Supabase), World ID proof verification, blockchain interactions (via QuickNode), and authentication services.
-   **Supabase:** Provides database (PostgreSQL), authentication, and real-time subscription services.
-   **World Chain:** The L2 blockchain where smart contracts are deployed and transactions occur.
-   **Smart Contracts (Solidity):** Manage NFT minting, verification tiers, loan issuance, and repayments.

Key interactions:
1.  User interacts with the frontend.
2.  Frontend communicates with the Cloudflare Workers backend for operations requiring private keys or complex logic (e.g., World ID proof verification, Supabase interactions).
3.  Frontend interacts directly with World Chain smart contracts for on-chain actions (e.g., sending transactions via Wagmi).
4.  Backend interacts with Supabase for data storage and retrieval, and with QuickNode for blockchain data and transaction relaying.

## NFT Verification System

The NFT Verification System utilizes World ID credentials to mint tier-specific NFTs that serve as collateral:

-   **Process Flow:**
    1.  The user initiates authentication via the World ID interface (`@worldcoin/idkit`).
    2.  The frontend sends the ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) to the backend (Cloudflare Worker).
    3.  The backend verifies the proof against the Worldcoin Developer Portal (or on-chain verifier).
    4.  Upon successful verification, the backend may trigger a smart contract function (or instruct the frontend to do so) to mint an NFT corresponding to the user's verification tier (Device, Passport, ORB).
    5.  NFT metadata (stored on-chain or off-chain) determines the user's loan eligibility.
-   **Key Components:**
    -   `UpgradeVerification` UI: Interactive interface for users.
    -   `useMagnifyWorld` Hook: Manages tier IDs, verification levels, NFT data caching, and state.

Example snippet from `useMagnifyWorld` hook (illustrative):
```typescript
// useMagnifyWorld hook snippet
const { data, refetch } = useMagnifyWorld(walletAddress);
const currentTier = data?.nftInfo.tier?.verificationStatus;

{{ ... }}
// useMagnifyWorld hook snippet
const { data, refetch } = useMagnifyWorld(walletAddress);
const currentTier = data?.nftInfo.tier?.verificationStatus;

// Cache invalidation for wallet data
export function invalidateCache(walletAddress: `0x${"string"}`) {
  delete globalCache[walletAddress]; // Example, actual implementation may vary
}
```

## Loan Management

{{ ... }}

## Loan Management

Loan management leverages NFT collateral to provide undercollateralized loans:

-   **Loan Request Process:**
    1.  The user requests a loan using their minted NFT as collateral.
    2.  The system (smart contract) validates NFT ownership and eligibility based on tier parameters.
    3.  The loan is issued from the smart contract if sufficient funds are available in the pool.
-   **Loan Repayment:** Uses Permit2 functionality for secure, EIP-2612 style permissioned token transfers to repay loans, enhancing UX by potentially reducing transaction steps.
-   **Contract Integration:** The V2 and V3 contracts extend V1, incorporating new events (e.g., `LoanRequested`, `LoanRepaid`, `LoanTokensWithdrawn`) and robust query capabilities.

Representative V2/V3 contract snippet (conceptual):
```solidity
// Example: Requesting a loan in MagnifyWorldV2 or V3
function requestLoan() external nonReentrant {
    uint256 tokenId = userNFT[msg.sender]; // Simplified, actual may differ
    require(tokenId != 0, "No NFT owned");
    // ... (owner checks, tier validation, active loan checks for V1/V2/V3) ...

    (uint256 loanAmount, uint256 interestRate, uint256 loanPeriod) = tiers[nftToTier[tokenId]];
    require(loanToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= loanAmount, "Insufficient contract balance");

    activeLoans[tokenId] = Loan(
        loanAmount,
        block.timestamp,
        true,
        interestRate,
        loanPeriod
{{ ... }}
}
```

## Smart Contract Integration

The project's smart contracts are deployed on World Chain (Chain ID 480).

-   **MagnifyWorld V1:** Core NFT minting, verification, and initial loan functionalities.
-   **MagnifyWorld V2 & V3:** Extend V1 with dynamic loan management, Permit2 integration, and improved query functions. Contract addresses are managed via `VITE_MAGNIFY_WORLD_ADDRESS_V2` and `VITE_MAGNIFY_WORLD_ADDRESS_V3` environment variables.

It is recommended to use `pragma solidity ^0.8.25;` or a higher compatible version. Contracts should adhere to Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, use custom errors, and emit events for state changes.

Smart contract source files are typically located in a `/contracts` or `/packages/foundry-project/contracts` directory (please verify actual location in the codebase).

## Frontend & State Management

-   **Routing & Protected Pages:** React Router (`react-router-dom`) manages navigation. Protected routes ensure only authenticated users access sensitive areas (e.g., Profile, Wallet, Loan pages).
    ```jsx
    <Route path="/upgrade-verification" element={
      <ProtectedRoute>
        <UpgradeVerification />
      </ProtectedRoute>
    } />
    ```
-   **State & Data Caching:** TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) for server state management (fetching, caching, synchronizing asynchronous data). Custom React hooks (e.g., `useMagnifyWorld`, `useRepayLoan`) encapsulate blockchain interaction logic and state.
-   **Component Structure:** Components are organized under `src/components/`, often utilizing `shadcn/ui` for pre-built, accessible UI elements, and `Tailwind CSS` for styling.

## Security Considerations

-   **World ID Proof Validation:** Backend (Cloudflare Worker) verifies ZKPs from World ID to ensure authenticity and prevent replay attacks. Short expiration windows for proofs are critical.
-   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented on sensitive backend endpoints and potentially in smart contracts (e.g., cooldown periods for verification attempts).
    ```solidity
    // Smart contract modifier example
    modifier checkCooldown() {
      require(block.timestamp > lastVerificationAttempt[msg.sender] + VERIFICATION_COOLDOWN, "Cooldown active");
      _;
    }
    ```
-   **Data Privacy:** Minimize storage and transmission of sensitive user data. Encrypt where necessary.
-   **Smart Contract Safeguards:** Adherence to security best practices like Checks-Effects-Interactions, reentrancy guards (`nonReentrant`), input validation, and use of well-audited libraries (OpenZeppelin). Regular audits are recommended.
-   **Environment Variable Security:** Never commit `.env` files containing secrets. Use `.gitignore`.
-   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs on the frontend and backend to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

## Deployment

The application is typically deployed to Netlify (frontend) and Cloudflare Workers (backend).

-   **Frontend (Netlify):** The `netlify.toml` file configures build settings, redirects, and environment variables for different contexts (production, staging, development). Netlify automatically builds and deploys from the connected Git repository.
-   **Backend (Cloudflare Workers):** Deployment of the worker script (e.g., using Wrangler CLI).

Ensure all necessary environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section) are configured in your deployment platform's settings.

## Development & Contribution Guidelines

-   **Expanded Collateral Types:** Support for other forms of collateral beyond World ID NFTs.

## Troubleshooting

### RPC and Network Issues

#### Withdrawal Transaction Failures
If you experience withdrawal transaction failures with "Internal JSON-RPC error":

1. **Check RPC Consistency**: Ensure all components use the same RPC provider
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes cached RPC responses can cause issues  
3. **Switch Networks**: Disconnect and reconnect to World Chain in your wallet
4. **Try Again**: RPC issues are often temporary

#### RPC Configuration
The application uses QuickNode for World Chain RPC connections:
- **Primary RPC**: `https://yolo-intensive-owl.worldchain-mainnet.quiknode.pro/02bc3fb4f359e0c2dadc693ec8c9de8288edfad8/`
- **Chain ID**: 480 (World Chain)
- **All transaction confirmations and state queries use this endpoint**

#### Recent Changes (December 2024)
- **Migration**: Moved from Alchemy public RPC to QuickNode for improved reliability
- **Consistency**: All frontend components now use the same RPC endpoint
- **Backend Alignment**: Backend also updated to use QuickNode infrastructure

### Known Issues
- **Pool Withdrawals**: During high network congestion, withdrawals may take longer to confirm
- **MetaMask**: Ensure you're connected to World Chain network (Chain ID: 480)
- **Rate Limiting**: Public RPC endpoints may have rate limits during peak usage
